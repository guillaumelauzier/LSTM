# LSTM

LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is designed to handle the issue of vanishing and exploding gradients in traditional RNNs. LSTM models have a more complex structure than traditional RNNs, with an additional memory cell that is used to control the flow of information through the network.

The memory cell is responsible for remembering long-term dependencies in the data, while the input and output gates control the flow of information into and out of the cell. The forget gate determines which information to discard from the cell, and the output gate decides which information to output from the cell.

LSTM models are widely used for applications such as speech recognition, image captioning, natural language processing, and time series prediction, where long-term dependencies are important.
