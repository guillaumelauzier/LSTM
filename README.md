# LSTM

LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is designed to handle the issue of vanishing and exploding gradients in traditional RNNs. LSTM models have a more complex structure than traditional RNNs, with an additional memory cell that is used to control the flow of information through the network.

The memory cell is responsible for remembering long-term dependencies in the data, while the input and output gates control the flow of information into and out of the cell. The forget gate determines which information to discard from the cell, and the output gate decides which information to output from the cell.

LSTM models are widely used for applications such as speech recognition, image captioning, natural language processing, and time series prediction, where long-term dependencies are important.

# lib.cpp

The code implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for predicting the next value in a time series. The LSTM architecture includes input, forget, and output gates, as well as a cell state that is used to store information over time. The gates and cell state are controlled by weights and biases that are learned during training.

The predictNextValue function performs forward propagation through the LSTM to predict the next value in the time series. It takes as input the current time series data X and the model parameters Wf, bf, Wi, bi, Wc, bc, Wo, bo, Wy, and by. It initializes the hidden and cell state vectors and performs forward propagation through the input, forget, and output gates to compute the cell state and hidden state vectors. The output layer is then used to predict the next value in the time series.

The main function initializes the LSTM model parameters and trains the model using backpropagation through time. It uses gradient descent to update the model parameters based on the loss computed during forward propagation. The training loop runs for a specified number of epochs, with each epoch consisting of forward propagation followed by backpropagation through time. The loop updates the weights and biases of the LSTM gates and cell state based on the gradients computed during backpropagation.

Finally, the trained LSTM model is used to predict the next value in the time series by calling the predictNextValue function with the trained model parameters and the current time series data. The predicted value is printed to the console.
